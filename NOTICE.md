## App store exception

As an additional permission under section 7 of the AGPL v3.0, the copyright holder permits
distribution of the tamagym mobile application through app store platforms (such as the
Apple App Store and Google Play) whose terms of service would otherwise be incompatible
with the AGPL, provided the corresponding source code remains available under the AGPL at
the project repository. This permission applies to the distribution channel only and does
not otherwise limit the license.

## Body diagram geometry

The muscle outlines used by `priv/catalogue/body_paths.json` are derived from
[**MuscleMap**](https://github.com/melihcolpan/MuscleMap) by Melih Colpan. They are used under
the MIT License. MuscleMap ships its paths as Swift source; the paths were converted to JSON and
sub-group shapes were dropped without otherwise changing the artwork.

## Exercise data & media

tamagym obtains both through
[**hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset**](https://github.com/hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset), which
licenses them differently. Neither is covered by tamagym's AGPL license.

That dataset is itself a redistribution: the content originates from
[**ExerciseDB v1**](https://exercisedb.dev/) by **AscendAPI**. This is verifiable from tamagym's
own data — the stored media filenames embed ExerciseDB's `exerciseId` (tamagym's `0001` is
`0001-2gPfomN.jpg`; `2gPfomN` is ExerciseDB's id for "3/4 sit-up"), every metadata field matches,
and the instruction sentences are identical apart from stripped `Step:N ` prefixes. See
[issue #5](https://github.com/hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset/issues/5) on that dataset.

### Metadata & instruction text

The English exercise names, attributes and instructions in
`priv/catalogue/exercises.json` originate from ExerciseDB v1 and reach tamagym through the
dataset above, which distributes them under the MIT license reproduced below.

### Images & animations — third-party, not MIT and not AGPL

The exercise thumbnails (180×180) and animations are **not** covered by the MIT license above and
**not** by tamagym's AGPL. Their ownership is currently **unresolved**, and tamagym states this
plainly rather than guessing:

- The upstream dataset attributes them to **© [Gym visual](https://gymvisual.com/)**, redistributed
  there with that rights holder's written permission — a permission granted to *that dataset* and
  **not transferable**.
- **ExerciseDB/AscendAPI** describes itself as "the original creator and owner" of this content and
  publishes its own [terms](https://exercisedb.io/faq), which permit self-hosting, bundling and
  commercial display, while prohibiting redistribution of the raw dataset or media as a standalone
  or competing content package.

These two claims contradict each other. A clarification has been requested from AscendAPI; this
notice will be updated once the provenance is settled.

**Until then, treat the media as third-party content licensed to neither tamagym nor to you.**

**tamagym does not redistribute it.** It is not in this repository, not in its history, and not in
the published container images or the Android APK. A self-hosted instance downloads it from the
upstream source on first `docker compose up`; the mobile and demo builds load it from a CDN at
runtime.

If you want to reuse the media — in tamagym or anywhere else, commercially or not — **clear it with
the rights holder first**, and keep any attribution that accompanies it intact.
